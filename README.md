## How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document outlines the process for contributing to our project. Your contributions can make a real difference, and we appreciate every effort you make to help improve this project.

## Getting Started

1. **Identify your target software engineering task** (Unfamiliar with SE tasks? Find them [here](https://github.com/gai4se/LLM4SE?tab=readme-ov-file#paper-list)!)

You can either choose to integrate an existing evaluation technique or add a new evaluation technique. 

Note, there could be evaluation tasks that are currently being worked on. Check the pull requests tab to see if a task is already in the works

3. **Integrate the evaluation method**

Ensure that you have a detailed readme that describes how to use the evaluation method.

An example of an evaluation method and appropriate readme can be found [here](https://github.com/SEEDGuard/SEVAL/tree/main/src/tasks/code_generation).

3. **Add a test script for you evaluation**

In order to ensure the validity of the evaluation method, we require that you provide a test script as well. 

There is a separate test folder that you must add your tests to. We also ask that you provide a 'how-to-test' section in your readme, detailing how to test the evaluation method.

An example test script can be found [here](https://github.com/SEEDGuard/SEVAL/blob/main/src/test/code_generation/test.py).
